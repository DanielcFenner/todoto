# todoto
A multi-platform hyper simple todo list app with no bloat.

# Description
While learning to code, I went through lots of practice projects - most of them I really wasn't interested in and they just served their purpose of me learning to program. However, I was always interested in making a super simplified todo app that works across multiple platforms as I find even though there are a million todo apps, they often just have too much bloat. So my goal is to create a super simple todo app, that works everywhere and also with the ability to share lists with friends. I'm still learning, so this is mostly a project I'm going to be continually coming back to and adding onto as a I learn new things.
